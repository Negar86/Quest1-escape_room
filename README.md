The user starts the game in a game room and can choose to either explore the room or unlock a door. The keys are hidden among the room's items. If the user finds the correct key for the door, they can escape to another room and continue doing so until they reach the outside. If the user chooses a door for which they do not have the key, they cannot escape. If they choose an item that is not in the room, they are asked to enter the correct item.
